Vaccine is a powerful, enterprise-grade SQL injection vulnerability scanner built with a focus on **clean architecture**, **design patterns**, and **SOLID principles**. This project demonstrates professional-level software engineering applied to cybersecurity tooling.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Vaccine is not just another SQL injection scanner-it's a **carefully architected security tool** that showcases:

- ✅ **Multiple Detection Strategies**: Error-based, Union-based, Boolean-based, and Time-based injection detection
- ✅ **DBMS Fingerprinting**: Intelligent database detection and dialect-specific payload generation
- ✅ **Automated Enumeration**: Extract database structure, tables, and data once a vulnerability is found
- ✅ **Enterprise Design Patterns**: Strategy, Factory, Facade, and more
- ✅ **SOLID Principles**: Clean, maintainable, and extensible codebase
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Multi-protocol support (GET/POST) with custom headers and bodies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Build

```bash
make
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
./vaccine "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1"
```

This single command will:
1. Parse the target URL and extract parameters
2. Fingerprint the database management system
3. Test all parameters with **4 powerful injection strategies**
4. Enumerate database information if vulnerabilities are found
5. Generate a detailed report in `vaccine.txt`

## 💪 Power & Capabilities

### Multi-Strategy Attack Surface

Vaccine employs **four distinct injection strategies**, each designed to detect different types of SQL injection vulnerabilities:

#### 1️⃣ **Error-Based Detection**
- Triggers database errors and analyzes error messages
- Identifies DBMS type through error fingerprinting
- Fast and reliable for verbose error configurations

#### 2️⃣ **Union-Based Detection**
- Leverages SQL UNION operators to extract data
- Automatically determines the number of columns
- Enables direct data exfiltration

#### 3️⃣ **Boolean-Based Detection**
- Analyzes response differences based on true/false conditions
- Works in blind injection scenarios
- Highly effective against filtered applications

#### 4️⃣ **Time-Based Detection**
- Uses time delays to infer SQL execution
- The most stealthy approach
- Works even when no visible output is returned

### DBMS Fingerprinting Engine

Vaccine doesn't just test for vulnerabilities-it **intelligently identifies** the target database:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
- SQLite

Once detected, Vaccine uses **database-specific dialects** to craft optimal payloads, maximizing success rates.

### Automated Data Enumeration

When a vulnerability is confirmed, Vaccine automatically:
- Extracts the current database name
- Lists all available databases
- Enumerates tables in the target database
- Retrieves column information
- Dumps sensitive data

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Excellence

### Design Patterns Implemented

#### 🔹 **Strategy Pattern**
The core of Vaccine's power lies in the **Strategy Pattern**. Each injection technique is encapsulated as a strategy:

```
InjectionStrategy (interface)
├── ErrorBasedStrategy
├── UnionBasedStrategy
├── BooleanBasedStrategy
└── TimeBasedStrategy
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to add new detection techniques
- Strategies can be enabled/disabled independently
- Each strategy is tested and maintained in isolation
- Follows Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification)

#### 🔹 **Factory Pattern**
The `DbmsDialectFactory` creates database-specific dialects:

```
DbmsDialectFactory
├── MySqlDialect
├── PostgreSqlDialect
├── MsSqlDialect
├── OracleDialect
└── SqliteDialect
```

**Benefits:**
- Centralizes object creation logic
- Supports runtime dialect selection based on fingerprinting
- Easily extensible for new database types

#### 🔹 **Facade Pattern**
The `VaccineFacade` provides a simplified interface to the complex scanning system:

```java
VaccineFacade facade = new VaccineFacade();
ScanResult result = facade.scan(config);
```

**Benefits:**
- Hides complex subsystem interactions
- Provides a clean API for clients
- Manages dependency assembly and orchestration

#### 🔹 **Provider Pattern**
The `InjectionStrategyProvider` manages strategy instances:

**Benefits:**
- Centralized strategy management
- Consistent strategy lifecycle
- Easy to modify the strategy set

## 📦 Build System

Vaccine uses a **professional Makefile** for build automation:

```bash
make          # Build the project
make clean    # Remove compiled files
make rebuild  # Clean and rebuild
make run      # Build and run with default settings
```

## 🏆 Why Vaccine Stands Out

1. **Professional Architecture**: Built like enterprise security software
2. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new strategies, DBMS support, or features
3. **Multiple Attack Vectors**: 4 distinct strategies ensure comprehensive coverage
4. **Intelligent Detection**: DBMS fingerprinting enables targeted attacks
5. **Clean Code**: Follows industry best practices and SOLID principles
6. **Educational Value**: Demonstrates advanced software engineering in cybersecurity
